### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Augene Pak, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Washington majoring in [Informatics](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics).

I'm currently working on reestablishing fundamentals. I'm reviewing web development by developing my [personal website](https://github.com/augene/augene.github.io). I'm also reviewing basic programming concepts by revisiting content from my first two programming classes â€” AP Computer Science A and CSE 143 â€” through solving problems on [Practice-It!](https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/problem/list), which was used for homework in high school when I first learned to program.

Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augenepak/) or shoot me an [email](mailto:ajp824@uw.edu)!
