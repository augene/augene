My name is Augene Pak, and I am a rising senior at the University of Washington majoring in [Informatics](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics) with an estimated graduation date of 2024. I aspire to be a software engineer upon graduation.

I'm currently working as a returning TechStart intern at Liberty Mutual for the summer, specializing in data engineering. I am learning the fundamentals of Python and data engineering, while also learning how to be a better professional and person.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augenepak/) or shoot me an [email](mailto:augene.pak@gmail.com)!
